# Clearscore Coding Exercise - Andrew Ashall

##Â Set up

1. Clone repo using `git clone ...`
2. Install poetry using `python -m pip3 install poetry`
3. Install packages `poetry install`
4. Activate the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. open `src/paths.py` and replace the paths with the data dir locations

## Producing outputs

Each file within `src/` corresponds to a question and will product a single csv file with the expected outputs in the outputs directory. To run all files and produce the output csv files make sure the python virtual environment is active and run `python src/main.py`
